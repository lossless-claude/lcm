# Configuration guide

## Quick start

Install the `lcm` binary and add the plugin:

```bash
npm install -g @lossless-claude/lcm  # provides the `lcm` command
claude plugin add github:lossless-claude/lcm
lcm install
```

`lcm install` writes config, registers hooks, installs slash commands, registers MCP, and verifies the daemon.

Set recommended environment variables:

```bash
export LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT=32
export LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH=-1
```

Restart Claude Code.

## Connector scope

The connector manager can install into either the current project or your global
agent config. For Codex, the global target is `~/.codex/`.

```bash
# Install the Codex skill globally instead of into the current repo
lcm connectors install codex --global

# Inspect or remove the global connector later
lcm connectors doctor --global
lcm connectors remove codex --global
```

Use the global flag when you want Codex to pick up the connector from your
user-level config rather than a single repository checkout.

## Tuning guide

### Context threshold

`LCM_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD` (default `0.75`) controls when compaction triggers as a fraction of the model's context window.

- **Lower values** (e.g., 0.5) trigger compaction earlier, keeping context smaller but doing more LLM calls for summarization.
- **Higher values** (e.g., 0.85) let conversations grow longer before compacting, reducing summarization cost but risking overflow with large model responses.

For most use cases, 0.75 is a good balance.

### Fresh tail count

`LCM_FRESH_TAIL_COUNT` (default `32`) is the number of most recent messages that are never compacted. These raw messages give the model immediate conversational continuity.

- **Smaller values** (e.g., 8–16) save context space for summaries but may lose recent nuance.
- **Larger values** (e.g., 32–64) give better continuity at the cost of a larger mandatory context floor.

For coding conversations with tool calls (which generate many messages per logical turn), 32 is recommended.

### Leaf fanout

`LCM_LEAF_MIN_FANOUT` (default `8`) is the minimum number of raw messages that must be available outside the fresh tail before a leaf pass runs.

- Lower values create summaries more frequently (more, smaller summaries).
- Higher values create larger, more comprehensive summaries less often.

### Condensed fanout

`LCM_CONDENSED_MIN_FANOUT` (default `4`) controls how many same-depth summaries accumulate before they're condensed into a higher-level summary.

- Lower values create deeper DAGs with more levels of abstraction.
- Higher values keep the DAG shallower but with more nodes at each level.

### Incremental max depth

`LCM_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH` (default `0`) controls whether condensation happens automatically after leaf passes.

- **0** — Only leaf summaries are created incrementally. Condensation only happens during manual `/compact` or overflow.
- **1** — After each leaf pass, attempt to condense d0 summaries into d1.
- **2+** — Deeper automatic condensation up to the specified depth.
- **-1** — Unlimited depth. Condensation cascades as deep as needed after each leaf pass. Recommended for long-running sessions.

### Summary target tokens

`LCM_LEAF_TARGET_TOKENS` (default `1200`) and `LCM_CONDENSED_TARGET_TOKENS` (default `2000`) control the target size of generated summaries.

- Larger targets preserve more detail but consume more context space.
- Smaller targets are more aggressive, losing detail faster.

The actual summary size depends on the LLM's output; these values are guidelines passed in the prompt's token target instruction.

### Prompt recall budgeting

Prompt-time recall now has a second budget layer after `/prompt-search` ranking.

- `restoration.promptSearchMaxResults` still controls how many top-ranked results the route aims to consider first.
- `restoration.promptSnippetLength` still controls the per-result snippet size before final emission.
- `restoration.maxInjectedMemoryItems` caps how many deduped hints can survive into the final `<memory-context>` block.
- `restoration.dedupMinPrefix` dedupes identical or near-identical hints by normalized prefix before emission.
- `restoration.maxInjectedMemoryBytes` caps the final prompt-time memory injection budget.
- `restoration.reservedForLearningInstruction` reserves room for `<learning-instruction>` before any hints are emitted.

In practice, the hook asks the daemon for ranked candidates, the daemon dedupes and trims them against the final byte budget, and only the emitted hints get surfaced back to the hook. That means increasing `promptSearchMaxResults` without adjusting `maxInjectedMemoryBytes` just gives the reranker more candidates to choose from; it does not guarantee more emitted context.

### Leaf chunk tokens

`LCM_LEAF_CHUNK_TOKENS` (default `20000`) caps the amount of source material per leaf compaction pass.

- Larger chunks create more comprehensive summaries from more material.
- Smaller chunks create summaries more frequently from less material.
- This also affects the condensed minimum input threshold (10% of this value).

## Model selection

LCM defaults to `LCM_SUMMARY_PROVIDER=auto`.

- In Claude sessions, `auto` resolves to `claude-process`
- In Codex sessions, `auto` resolves to `codex-process`
- If you explicitly set `LCM_SUMMARY_PROVIDER`, that override applies to both CLIs

You can pin a specific summarizer provider and model:

```bash
# Use a specific provider + model for summarization
export LCM_SUMMARY_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
export LCM_SUMMARY_PROVIDER=anthropic
```

Valid provider values are:

- `auto`
- `claude-process`
- `codex-process`
- `anthropic`
- `openai`
- `disabled`

Using a cheaper or faster model for summarization can reduce costs, but quality matters because poor summaries compound as they are condensed into higher-level nodes.

## Stale memory review

Promoted memories stay active indefinitely unless manually archived. Over time, some become stale: old project knowledge that is no longer correct or useful, but keeps surfacing.

LCM identifies stale candidates by combining age with recall feedback signals:

- **Age threshold** (`restoration.staleAfterDays`, default 90): memories older than this are evaluated for staleness.
- **Surfacing without use** (`restoration.staleSurfacingWithoutUseLimit`, default 5): if a memory has been surfaced this many times without ever being acted upon, it is a stale candidate.
- **Restore age limit** (`restoration.restoreMaxPromotedAgeDays`, default 180): the restore route suppresses promoted memories older than this.
- **Stale penalty** (`restoration.stalePenalty`, default 0.5): score penalty applied to stale candidates during prompt-time ranking.
- **Strong match override** (`restoration.allowStaleOnStrongMatch`, default true): when enabled, stale memories can still surface if their relevance score is high enough despite the penalty.

### Inspecting stale candidates

Use `lcm review-stale` or call the `/review-stale` daemon endpoint to list stale candidates with their surfacing and usage counts.

### Archiving and reviving

Stale candidates can be archived non-destructively. Archived memories are excluded from search and recall but remain in the database and can be revived later.

The `/review-stale` endpoint accepts `action: "archive"` or `action: "revive"` with a `target_id` to manage individual memories.

### Stats integration

Run `lcm stats --verbose` to see a summary of stale memory candidates across all projects.


## Database management

Each project's SQLite database lives at `~/.lossless-claude/projects/<sha256-of-project-path>/db.sqlite`. The per-project path is derived automatically from the working directory.

### Inspecting the database

```bash
# Find your project hash
lcm stats

# Open the database (replace <hash> with your project hash)
sqlite3 ~/.lossless-claude/projects/<hash>/db.sqlite

# Count conversations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversations;

# See context items for a conversation
SELECT * FROM context_items WHERE conversation_id = 1 ORDER BY ordinal;

# Check summary depth distribution
SELECT depth, COUNT(*) FROM summaries GROUP BY depth;

# Find large summaries
SELECT summary_id, depth, token_count FROM summaries ORDER BY token_count DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Backup

The database is a single file per project. Back it up with:

```bash
cp ~/.lossless-claude/projects/<hash>/db.sqlite ~/.lossless-claude/projects/<hash>/db.sqlite.backup
```

Or use SQLite's online backup:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.lossless-claude/projects/<hash>/db.sqlite ".backup /tmp/lcm-backup.sqlite"
```

## Per-agent configuration

In multi-agent Claude Code setups, each agent uses the same LCM database but has its own conversations (keyed by session ID). The plugin config applies globally; per-agent overrides use environment variables set in the agent's config.

## Disabling LCM

To fall back to Claude Code's built-in compaction:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "contextEngine": "legacy"
    }
  }
}
```

Or set `LCM_ENABLED=false` to disable the plugin while keeping it registered.
